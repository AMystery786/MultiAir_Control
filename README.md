# MultiAir_Control
INTRO*
one of the FIAT'S awesome valve system equipped in the Fiat’s MultiAir 1,4 (MultiAir I) Technology, which allows a more “Independent Valve Drive “ for the intake valves.
The system which is same for the MultiAir II
(code name : TigerShark 2,4 Ltr)
Allows the manufacturer to replace the intake camshafts with a lighter and more efficient MultiAir system,
But what does it mean for any alternate fuel user ??
The problem of “uncontrolled valve timing “ by the Pb ECU will cause inefficient fuel combustion
To solve this problem, we used our latest innovation by emulating the “Oil Temp” now you may wonder what’s the relation with oil temp. and valve drive ?

If the Oil isn’t hot enough (variable oil temp through the device ) Advanced valve drive won’t be activated and the Pb ECU would work on a “Simplified” Strategy which will be great news as we can now combust fuel easily
 
The buzz from the industry is growing as this is something people have been waiting for a long time.
